function [model,measlog,xlog] = gentruth(Pd,lfai,numtruth,Pmid,pmi,slideWindow)
%GENTRUTH: GENERATE SIMULATION TRUTH
%Syntax: [model,measlog,xlog] = gentruth(Pd,lfai,numtruth,n,Pmid,pmi)
%Input:
% Pd is the probability of detection
% lfai is the expected number of false alarms per scan
% numtruth is the maximum number of targets (see below)
% Pmid is the covariance of the initial target state (see below)
% pmi is the "case number" determining target birth times (if pmi=1,
%  targets all exist from the beginning, otherwise a new target is born
%  every 10 time steps, and any targets not existing before the mid-point
%  are born at the mid-point)
%Output:
% model is the matlab structure describing the dynamics and measurement
%  models
% measlog{t}(:,j) is the j-th measurement at time t
% xlog{t}(:,i) is the true state of the i-th target at time t
%Note: simulation is initialised at mid-point in time with target states
% randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and covariance
% Pmid.
