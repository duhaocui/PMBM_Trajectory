%PREDICT: PREDICT MULTI-BERNOULLI AND POISSON COMPONENTS
%Syntax: [r,x,P] = tomb(pupd,rupd,xupd,Pupd,pnew,rnew,xnew,Pnew)
%Input:
% r(i), x(:,i) and P(:,:,i) give the probability of existence, state
%  estimate and covariance for the i-th multi-Bernoulli component (track)
% lambdau(k), xu(:,k) and Pu(:,:,k) give the intensity, state estimate and
%  covariance for the k-th mixture component of the unknown target Poisson
%  Point Process (PPP)
%model is structure describing target birth and transition models
%Output:
% Predicted components in same format as input
%Software implements pseudocode described in http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2995
